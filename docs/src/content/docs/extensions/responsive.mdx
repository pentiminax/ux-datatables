# Responsive Extension

## When To Use

Use Responsive for mobile-heavy usage and columns that cannot all fit on one line.

## Minimal Example

```php
$dataTable->responsive();
```

## Advanced Example

```php
use Pentiminax\UX\DataTables\Model\Extensions\ResponsiveExtension;

$dataTable->addExtension(new ResponsiveExtension());
```

## Frequent Pitfalls

- Not setting column priorities when too many columns compete for visibility.
- Combining with checkbox selection without validating first-column rendering.
